    "It would take quite a lot of time to manually insert the genre for each of the artists that appear in this dataset, luckily through the use of an API it is possible to get the genre of each artist within the dataset. The API I chose to use for this was the **Spotify Web API** which will provide us with a lot of data about each of the artists including their genres. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### Steps Taken:\r\n",
    "1. **Register an Application:** Create an application in your Spotify Developer Dashboard to get the `client_id` and `client_secret`.\r\n",
    "2. **Authentication:** Use these credentials to authenticate with Spotify's API and obtain an access token.\r\n",
    "3. **Fetch Artist Data:** Make requests to the API to fetch data about each artist, including their genre.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### What the Code Does:\r\n",
    "1. Imported the necessary libraries such as `spotipy` for interacting with the Spotify API, `pandas` for data manipulation, and `time` for managing timeouts.\r\n",
    "2. Used pandas to load in the dataset containing streaming history with artist names.\r\n",
    "3. Extracted unique artist names from the dataset to avoid duplicate API calls.\r\n",
    "4. Initialized Spotipy with user credentials and increased timeout.\r\n",
    "5. Created a function to fetch genres for each artist with retry logic if unsuccessful the first time.\r\n",
    "6. Created an empty dictionary to hold artist genres data retrieved from Spotify.\r\n",
    "7. Utilized the API through GET requests to fetch genres for each artist and added them to the dictionary.\r\n",
    "8. Added the fetched genres to the DataFrame.\r\n",
    "9. Created the pathname for the new CSV file and saved the updated DataFrame to the CSV file using the pathname.\r\n",

    "# Obtaining Audio Features for Each Track\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Steps Performed by the Code\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. I created a function called `get_audio_features` to fetch audio features for a given Spotify ID.\r\n",
    "2. I sent a request to the Spotify API's `audio-features` endpoint using the Spotify ID and access token provided.\r\n",
    "3. Upon receiving a response from the API:\r\n",
    "    a. If the response was successful (status code 200), I retrieved the audio features in JSON format.\r\n",
    "    b. If the response indicated that the rate limit was exceeded (status code 429), I waited for the specified duration (defaulting to 20 seconds if the header is missing) and tried fetching the audio features again.\r\n",
    "    c. If the response status code was neither 200 nor 429, I printed an error message and returned an empty dictionary.\r\n",
    "4. I loaded the dataset containing Spotify IDs for tracks into a DataFrame using pandas.\r\n",
    "5. I initialized a dictionary called `audio_features_lookup` to store audio features for known Spotify IDs.\r\n",
    "6. I prepared to store audio features in the DataFrame if they were not already present, ensuring columns for each audio feature.\r\n",
    "7. I defined an access token for the Spotify API, replacing `'your_access_token'` with the actual access token.\r\n",
    "8. I defined the batch size and started processing tracks from index 7000 to the end of the dataset in batches of 1000 tracks.\r\n",
    "9. I iterated over each batch of tracks and processed each track within the batch:\r\n",
    "    a. I checked if the Spotify ID for the track was not null.\r\n",
    "    b. I checked if the audio features for the track were not already cached.\r\n",
    "    c. If the audio features were not cached, I fetched them using the `get_audio_features` function, stored them in `audio_features_lookup`, and updated the DataFrame with the retrieved features.\r\n",
    "    d. If the audio features were cached, I used the cached audio features for the track and updated the DataFrame.\r\n",
    "    e. I saved the progress after processing each batch to a new CSV file.\r\n",
    "10. I completed the process, adding audio features to the DataFr## Where I got the idea from\n",

    "## Steps Performed by the Code\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. I loaded the dataset containing complete audio features for each track into a DataFrame using pandas. The information used to categorize the audio features was obtained from the [Spotify API documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. I defined functions to categorize each audio feature based on their descriptions and common interpretations provided in the documentation:\r\n",
    "    - **Danceability:** Categorized as Low, Medium, or High.\r\n",
    "    - **Energy:** Categorized as Low, Medium, or High.\r\n",
    "    - **Speechiness:** Categorized as Mostly Music, Music and Speech, or Mostly Speech.\r\n",
    "    - **Acousticness:** Categorized as Non-Acoustic, Mixed, or Acoustic.\r\n",
    "    - **Instrumentalness:** Categorized as Non-Instrumental, Mixed, or Instrumental.\r\n",
    "    - **Liveness:** Categorized as Studio Recording or Live Recording.\r\n",
    "    - **Valence:** Categorized as Sad, Neutral, or Happy.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. I applied the categorization functions to each respective audio feature column in the DataFrame, creating new categorical columns for each feature's category.\r\n",
